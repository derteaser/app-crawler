app-crawler
===========

The app-crawler can crawl a given web site and build a package from it that can be sent to <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap Build</a> service.

To use the crawler, integrate it to your application, create a new AppCrawler object and call the crawl()-method.

This piece of code was initially a part of my Bachelor Thesis project.
